title: "President Names"

We want to look at the percent of boys named the same first name as the president of the decade they were born into.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Three variables are made of each csv file for the three names.

```{r}
Grover <- read_csv('Grover.csv')

Theodore <- read_csv('Theodore.csv')

Richard <- read_csv('Richard.csv')

Ronald <- read_csv('Ronald.csv')
```

Proceed to sum the annual percentages to find one value for the decade to define the popularity of a name.

```{r}
Grover_Decade <- Grover %>%
  summarise(Decade_popularity = mean(Popularity))

Theodore_Decade <- Theodore %>%
  summarise(Decade_popularity = mean(Popularity))

Richard_Decade <- Richard %>%
  summarise(Decade_popularity = mean(Popularity))

Ronald_Decade <- Ronald %>%
  summarise(Decade_popularity = mean(Popularity))
```

Now that the variables have been found, a dataset can be made to plot the data.


```{r}
# reading the wikipedia csv file
wiki_names <- read_csv('presidents.csv') 

```





```{r}
# Finding occasions of name = president_name
wiki_presidential_names <- wiki_names %>%
  mutate(
    presidents_full = case_when(
      str_detect(name,"Ronald") ~ "Ronald",
      str_detect(name,"Richard") ~ "Richard",
      str_detect(name,"Theodore") ~ "Theodore",
      str_detect(name,"Grover") ~ "Grover",
      TRUE ~ "Other")
    )  %>%
  mutate(
    correct_decade = case_when(
      birthyear >= 1980 & birthyear <= 1991 ~ "Ronald",
      birthyear >= 1968 & birthyear <= 1979 ~ "Richard",
      birthyear >= 1900 & birthyear <= 1911 ~ "Theodore",
      birthyear >= 1884 & birthyear <= 1895 ~ "Grover",
      TRUE ~ "Other")
    )

```

```{r}
#summing up the relevant data
wiki_decade_table <- wiki_presidential_names %>%
  group_by(correct_decade, presidents_full) %>%
  mutate(
    Presidents_coincide = presidents_full == correct_decade
  ) %>%
  group_by(correct_decade, Presidents_coincide) %>%
  summarize(count = n())


wiki_decade_table <- filter(wiki_decade_table[4-7,])


  
```
