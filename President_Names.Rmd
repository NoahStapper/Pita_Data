title: "President Names"

We want to look at the percent of boys named the same first name as the president of the decade they were born into.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Three variables are made of each csv file for the three names.

```{r}
Grover <- read_csv('Grover.csv')

Theodore <- read_csv('Theodore.csv')

Richard <- read_csv('Richard.csv')

Ronald <- read_csv('Ronald.csv')
```

Proceed to sum the annual percentages to find one value for the decade to define the popularity of a name.

```{r}
Grover_Decade <- Grover %>%
  summarise(Decade_popularity = mean(Popularity))

Theodore_Decade <- Theodore %>%
  summarise(Decade_popularity = mean(Popularity))

Richard_Decade <- Richard %>%
  summarise(Decade_popularity = mean(Popularity))

Ronald_Decade <- Ronald %>%
  summarise(Decade_popularity = mean(Popularity))
```

Now that the variables have been found, a dataset can be made to plot the data.


```{r}
# reading the wikipedia csv file
wiki_names <- read_csv('presidents.csv') %>%
  mutate(
    birthyear = as.numeric(birthyear)
  )
```


```{r}
wiki_decade <- wiki_names %>%
  mutate(
    Grover1 = (str_detect(name, "Grover") & birthyear < 1894),
    Grover_yes = ifelse(Grover1, 'GROVER', 'NOT GROVER')
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    Theodore1 = (str_detect(name, "Theodore") & birthyear < 1911 & birthyear > 1900 ),
    Theodore_yes = ifelse(Theodore1, 'THEODORE', 'NOT THEODORE')
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    Richard1 = (str_detect(name, "Richard") & birthyear < 1979 & birthyear > 1968 ),
    Richard_yes = ifelse(Richard1, 'RICHARD', 'NOT RICHARD')
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    Ronald1 = (str_detect(name, "Ronald") & birthyear < 1991 & birthyear > 1980),
    Ronald_yes = ifelse(Ronald1, 'RONALD', 'NOT RONALD')
  )
```
