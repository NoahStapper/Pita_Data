We want to look at the percent of boys named the same first name as the president of the decade they were born into.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Three variables are made of each csv file for the three names.

```{r}
Grover <- read_csv('Grover.csv')

Theodore <- read_csv('Theodore.csv')

Richard <- read_csv('Richard.csv')

Ronald <- read_csv('Ronald.csv')
```

Proceed to sum the annual percentages to find one value for the decade to define the popularity of a name.

```{r}
Grover_Decade <- Grover %>%
  summarise(Decade_popularity = mean(Popularity))

Theodore_Decade <- Theodore %>%
  summarise(Decade_popularity = mean(Popularity))

Richard_Decade <- Richard %>%
  summarise(Decade_popularity = mean(Popularity))

Ronald_Decade <- Ronald %>%
  summarise(Decade_popularity = mean(Popularity))
```

Now that the variables have been found, a dataset can be made to plot the data.
